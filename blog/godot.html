    <h1>Im Leaving You, Unity, Because I Think I Am Falling In Love With Your Sister, Godot</h1>
    <p>
        (thank you mint for that title)
        once upon a time, i used to make games in unity. i started out by trying to make games in bevy, but i very quickly realized that it kind of. sucked. <a href="https://loglog.games/blog/leaving-rust-gamedev/">other people online have gone far more in depth than i can about this subject than i can but yeah.</a> so a friend showed me unity, and i learned it and i was happy because it didn't have so many issues that i had with bevy, but i was still unhappy for some reasons. </p>
        <p>
            <h2>Code and the editor</h2>
            in bevy, the engine i started with, there was no editor at all. every single thing was done through code. this was really annoying for some things(i'm not the world's biggest fan of assets through code, i like having some visual frame of reference for those) but it's also been really really nice for some other things. Unity, of course has an editor! so problem solved right? not really. there's this kind of odd divide between what can be done in code and what can be done in the editor. it's a really annoying sort of context switch when you're writing code doing your thing, and then you have to go "oh wait no i have to do this in the editor". speaking of the editor, that brings me to my second problem with Unity:
            <h2>The editor fucking sucks</h2>
            <p>
            the unity editor is one of the SLOWEST PIECES OF SHIT i've ever had the displeasure of using. opening it takes so goddamned long for whatever reason, and then after you wait for it to open, you have to wait for the slowass Unity Package Manager to do whatever fucking bullshit it's deciding to do this time
